# AGENTS.md

OpenCode plugin that adds the Google Gemini Antigravity CLI (`agy`) OAuth provider. This plugin intercepts `fetch()` calls from `@ai-sdk/google` and rewrites them to the Antigravity Code Assist endpoint with OAuth bearer auth, project context resolution, and server-supplied model enum mapping. The plugin ships its own `agy_quota` and `agy_quota_summary` tools.

## agy CLI bump workflow

When a new `agy` CLI release lands (check `https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/releases`), execute every step in sequence without skipping.

**CRITICAL MANDATE**: Always audit backend and protocol additions. Upstream release notes primarily highlight user-facing UI changes, but minor/patch releases frequently introduce unannounced backend protocol updates, internal RPC routes, header adjustments, or payload schema changes. Never assume a bump is client-only without performing the full binary and server inspection.

1. **Install or upgrade CLI locally**: Ensure `agy --version` matches the target release.
2. **Audit changelog & release notes**: Read `https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/releases/tag/<VERSION>` (note: tag is `<version>` without "v" prefix, e.g. `0.1.2`). Identify upstream bug fixes, protocol changes, new request parameters, error handling adjustments, or server-side capabilities.
3. **Inspect local agy binary**: Run `strings $(readlink -f $(which agy)) | grep -E 'v1internal|daily-cloudcode|CodeAssist'` to discover internal RPC routes, header adjustments, or payload changes. Diffing binary strings against the previous version reveals unannounced backend protocol changes.
4. **Inspect server response payloads & error structures**: Check live HTTP error payloads and retry headers (`retry-after-ms`, `error.details[]` structures like `type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.RetryInfo` or `QuotaFailure`). Test live quota calls with the `agy_quota` and `agy_quota_summary` tools to confirm server schema compatibility.
5. **Reconcile against surface review checklist**: Systematically cross-reference the [Surface review checklist](#surface-review-checklist) to verify whether any plugin component requires updates for new capabilities, endpoints, or error codes.
6. **Report analysis findings**: Explicitly report findings to the user. State clearly whether actionable features or protocol adjustments exist to implement, or confirm with evidence that all upstream changes are client-only (e.g. CLI UI, terminal rendering, keyring handling).
7. **Implement relevant plugin adjustments**: If actionable backend fixes or protocol changes were discovered in steps 2-6, implement and test them before bumping constants.
8. **Update version constants**: Update `src/sdk/agy-cli-version.ts` (`AGY_CLI_VERSION`) and `scripts/fetch-models.mjs` (`AGY_API_VERSION`) to the new version. This sets the `User-Agent` header on every Code Assist API request.
9. **Update release config**: Update `.release-please-config.json` (`"release-as"` field) to the new version. Do **not** touch `.release-please-manifest.json`; release-please manages it automatically on PR merge.
10. **Check dependencies**: Run `npm outdated` and bump dependencies to latest semver-compatible. (`@ai-sdk/google` is only a literal string reference in `src/plugin.ts`, so version bumps are zero-risk).
11. **Refresh model catalog & register models**: Run `npm run models:refresh` and verify diff (see [Refreshing models.json](#refreshing-modelsjson)). If new models appear (e.g. in `.models` or `agentModelSorts`), register them in `STATIC_MODELS_SIMPLE` and `TIER_MAPPING` in `src/plugin.ts` (see [Registering models in src/plugin.ts](#registering-models-in-srcplugints)). Also prune models from `STATIC_MODELS_SIMPLE` and `TIER_MAPPING` that are no longer usable or returned by the upstream `agy models` CLI command.
12. **Run full verification suite**: Execute `npm install && npm run test:coverage && npm run typecheck && npm run build && npm run smoke:node-import`. All tests and quality gates must pass cleanly.

Prior bump commits follow a consistent pattern. Run `git log --oneline | grep "bump agy cli"` for examples.

## Refreshing models.json

`models.json` is the Antigravity Code Assist internal model catalog returned by the `fetchAvailableModels` server API. It is **not** the same as the public-facing `agy models` command output, which is a filtered subset. The plugin's `src/sdk/request/prepare.ts` reads `models.json` at runtime to resolve model enum placeholders via `getModelEnum`.

To refresh:

```bash
npm run models:refresh
```

Or equivalently:

```bash
./scripts/fetch-models.mjs --verbose
```

The script:

1. Reads `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` and extracts the `google-agy.refresh` field, whose format is `refreshToken|projectId|managedProjectId`.
2. Refreshes the OAuth access token via `POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` using `AGY_CLIENT_ID` and `AGY_CLIENT_SECRET` (same values as `src/constants.ts`).
3. Calls `POST https://daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:fetchAvailableModels` with body `{"project": managedProjectId}`.
4. Writes the response (pretty-printed, 2-space indent) to `models.json` at the repo root.

Flags:

- `--endpoint <url>`: override the Code Assist endpoint (default `https://daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`).
- `--output <path>`: write to a different file (default `models.json` at repo root).
- `--verbose`: emit progress to stderr.

The script uses Node's built-in `fetch` (HTTP/2 capable). This is required because curl's HTTP/1.0 fallback fails due to network-level stream resets when sending the `Authorization` header against Google APIs from certain network environments; Node's HTTP/2 stream multiplexing handles it correctly.

### Verifying a refresh

After running `models:refresh`, diff old vs new `models.json` to identify:

- Model additions or removals in `.models` keys.
- Changes to `.defaultAgentModelId` (the agy CLI's default model).
- Changes to `.tieredModelIds.flash` (the tiered-flash parent model id, rotates across releases).
- New `.deprecatedModelIds` entries (model enum migrations).
- Changes to `.agentModelSorts[0].groups[0].modelIds` (the user-visible recommended list).

Always verify that `.deprecatedModelIds` for `gemini-3.1-pro-high` (mapping to `gemini-pro-agent` with enum `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER_M16`) is preserved. The plugin's `src/sdk/request/shared.ts:10` hardcodes a fallback rewrite of `gemini-3.1-pro-high` to `gemini-pro-agent`, which depends on this deprecation entry being present in `models.json` so `prepare.ts` `getModelEnum` resolves the correct enum.

## Registering models in src/plugin.ts

When new user-facing models are added to `models.json` (for example, new series entries like `gemini-3.8-flash` or major releases appearing in `agentModelSorts[0].groups[0].modelIds`), register them in `src/plugin.ts` so OpenCode exposes them:

1. **Add to `STATIC_MODELS_SIMPLE`**:
   - Define model key (e.g. `gemini-3.8-flash`) with `name`, `limit: { context: 1048576, output: 65536 }`, and default fallback `cost`.
2. **Add to `TIER_MAPPING`**:
   - Map tier aliases (`low`, `medium`, `high`) to the underlying model ID string (e.g. `low: "gemini-3.8-flash-low"`, `medium: "gemini-3.8-flash-medium"`, `high: "gemini-3.8-flash-high"`).
3. **Add unit test assertions**:
   - Update `test/plugin/plugin.test.ts` to assert that the newly registered model ID exists in provider models.

Note: internal preview strings or non-user-facing endpoints (like `chat_*` or internal tab models) should only remain in `models.json` for server enum mapping and do not need registration in `STATIC_MODELS_SIMPLE`.

## Surface review checklist

When reconciling agy CLI release notes against this plugin's code surface, check:

- `src/sdk/agy-cli-version.ts` - version constant
- `scripts/fetch-models.mjs` - `AGY_API_VERSION` constant
- `src/constants.ts` - client ID/secret, endpoints, OAuth scopes
- `src/sdk/user-agent.ts` - User-Agent builder using `AGY_CLI_VERSION`
- `src/sdk/request/prepare.ts` - request body transformation, `getModelEnum` reads from `models.json`
- `src/sdk/request/shared.ts` - model fallback rewrites (e.g., `gemini-3.1-pro-high` to `gemini-pro-agent`)
- `src/sdk/fetch_models.ts` - `fetchAvailableModels` endpoint interface (do not confuse with the `agy models` CLI command output)
- `src/sdk/fetch_quota.ts` - quota fetch helpers
- `src/sdk/retry/quota.ts` - quota classification (parses server-supplied `RetryInfo`)
- `src/sdk/retry/helpers.ts` - retry delay resolution (prioritizes `retry-after-ms`, then `retry-after`, then `parseRetryDelayFromBody`)
- `src/plugin.ts` - `STATIC_MODELS_SIMPLE`, `TIER_MAPPING`, fetch interceptor, provider registration
- `src/plugin/pricing.ts` - dynamic model cost resolution via models.dev
- `src/plugin/project/context.ts` - project context resolution (loadCodeAssist / onboardUser)
- `src/plugin/quota.ts` and `src/plugin/quota-summary.ts` - the agy_quota and agy_quota_summary tools
- `models.json` - internal server model catalog (different from `agy models` public-facing output)

## Important distinctions

- `agy models` (or `agy --output-format stream-json models`) returns the public-facing filtered model IDs (e.g., `gemini-3.5-flash-low`). This is the list users see in the CLI's model picker.
- The `fetchAvailableModels` API returns the full internal catalog including preview/internal models (e.g., `chat_20706`, `tab_flash_lite_preview`, `gemini-3.6-flash-tiered` with no `displayName`). This is what the plugin's `prepare.ts` reads at runtime.
- Only `models.json` is used by the plugin at runtime; the `agy models` output is informational and not consumed by the plugin code.
- `@ai-sdk/google` is never imported; it is only used as a literal npm-name string at `src/plugin.ts:179` and `src/plugin.ts:438`. Version bumps to this package are zero-risk regardless of API changes in the upstream package.
- The plugin's OAuth token storage lives at `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` under the `google-agy` key. The agy CLI itself uses the OS keyring directly; the opencode plugin maintains its own auth storage for portability.
- **Thinking / CoT Support**: Tiered Gemini models (`gemini-3.7/3.8-flash-high/medium`) currently have thinking suppressed by the upstream Code Assist server over SSE (it performs internal reasoning but does not stream raw `thought: true` parts back to the client, unlike Claude thinking models). When Google enables streaming thoughts for Flash tiers in future Code Assist protocol updates, add client response stream parsing and configuration support for them.

## Gotchas

- `.release-please-manifest.json` is auto-managed by release-please; do not manually edit it.
- When the agy CLI is not logged in (`agy --version` works but `agy` interactive fails with "could not open TTY"), the `agy models` command still works and returns a cached or session-less model list.
- curl may show `HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request` from a network security appliance intercepting `Authorization`-header requests against Google APIs. Use Node `fetch` instead (HTTP/2 stream multiplexing works correctly through such appliances). This is why `scripts/fetch-models.mjs` uses Node's built-in `fetch` rather than shelling out to `curl`.
- The `managedProjectId` (third pipe-separated field of the refresh token, e.g., `citric-engine-kl9s4`) is the value passed as the `project` body parameter to `fetchAvailableModels`, not the user-facing project ID. The user-facing project ID (second field, e.g., `tone-workspace-cli`) is not directly accepted by the API.
- A fresh `fetchAvailableModels` response will overwrite the entire `models.json` file. Diff old vs new before committing to catch any unintended server-side removals. Pay particular attention to the `deprecatedModelIds` entry for `gemini-3.1-pro-high` which the plugin's `shared.ts:10` fallback depends on.

## Build verification

```bash
npm install          # updates package-lock.json
npm test             # run unit test suite
npm run test:coverage # run tests with v8 code coverage enforcement
npm run typecheck    # tsc type check
npm run build        # tsup bundle + tsc declaration emit
npm run smoke:node-import  # verify dist/index.js loads without error
```

## Testing & Code Coverage

The repository uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with `@vitest/coverage-v8` for unit testing and code coverage enforcement.

### Test Commands

- `npm test`: Runs test suite once (`vitest run`).
- `npm run test:watch`: Runs tests in interactive watch mode (`vitest`).
- `npm run test:coverage`: Runs full suite and enforces code coverage thresholds (`vitest run --coverage`).

### Coverage Standards

- Minimum thresholds configured in `vitest.config.ts`:
  - **Lines**: >= 95%
  - **Functions**: >= 95%
  - **Statements**: >= 94%
  - **Branches**: >= 85%
- CI executes `npm run test:coverage` on every push and pull request. All new features and refactors must include unit tests maintaining >= 95% overall line and function coverage.

### Test Suite Organization

All tests are located in `test/` and organized by module:

- `test/sdk-*` & `test/sdk/`: Tests for request transformations, thinking configs, thought signatures, SSE streaming, retry backoff, quota error parsing, user-agent formatting, and OAuth helpers.
- `test/plugin-*` & `test/plugin/`: Tests for plugin lifecycle, authentication loading/refreshing, project context resolution, pricing updates, toast notifications, background traffic simulation, and the `agy_quota` / `agy_quota_summary` tools.

Validate `models.json` is well-formed JSON:

```bash
node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('models.json', 'utf8')); console.log('ok')"
```
